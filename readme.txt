"Pearson Exotronics" by tomatopaste. First started development in March 2020.
Art, sounds and programming are done by me, additional help is documented below. This isn't a locked vault, I'm
happy to share programming assets if asked and it's a reasonable request. The drone framework is somewhat modular so hit
me up if interested ;). Please enjoy!
